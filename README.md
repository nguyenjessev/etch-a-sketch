# Etch-a-Sketch
This is my Etch-a-Sketch project for The Odin Project

## Problems
I had to figure out how to generate new grids based on user form input, clear existing grids, and draw over the grid when the user moused over cells

## What I used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS grid, JS DOM manipulation

## What I learned
How to create dynamic webpages that the user can interact with, how to create, modify, and style HTML elements via JS
